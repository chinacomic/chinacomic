- 👋 Hi, I’m @chinacomic
- 👀 I’m interested most in Python and C, but I love a challenge - so I'll never turn down an opportunity to learn and grow. 
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself Rust, Golang, MongoDB and ScyllaDB as well as German, French, and Indonesian.
- I'm also looking to spend some free time soon learning typescript, htmx and typst.
- 📫 How to reach me: robb dot bossley at gmail
